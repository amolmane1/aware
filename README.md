App screenshots and Loom demo video coming soon!

A mobile app for people to log journal entries and track progress in their meditation journey. Users can add meditation sessions (can select the duration of their session, use a timer while they meditate, and add notes about how their session went). They can also add any insights they've gained, questions they have, and any general thoughts they have. The plan is to use AI and Data Science to analyze users' entries, so that users can learn patterns and get suggestions to impove their practice.

Built using:
- Typescript
- React Native
- React Navigation
- React Native Paper for styling
- AsyncStorage
